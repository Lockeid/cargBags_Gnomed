h1. cargBags_Gnomed

h2. What is this ?

This is a custom layout for cargBags based on cargBags_Pernobilis.
It uses filters so you can easily see your weapons, armor, quest items, trade goods and consumables. The Equipment bag won't show objects if you're using cargBags_Anywhere and watching another character's bag. I'm working on that.

All the frames are movables but their place will not be saved.

h2. Features
*Filtered bags and bank
*Dropdown to toggle bags
*kRestack support
*Equipment bag, to easily see if an item is in one of your item sets or not, if not it will show up in the Stuff bag.
*Tabard-O-Matic support
*cargBags_Anywhere support, now you can see Character choose with a little arrow in the filters bag)

h2. Localization

It should work on every client as I use the API which returns localized strings


h2. Known issues

*Sometimes the weapon bag has empty slots, they can be removed by either reload the UI or move an item in the main bag.



h2. To do
Only one icon for empty buttons

h2.Thanks
*Cargor for this wonderful addon
*Luzzifus for all his help (for equipments and frame placement)
